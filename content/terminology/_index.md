# Terminology

## Gate Ordering
### Ordinal Referencing
Gates are the most important reference for player understanding and relocation within Invasions.

Gates should be denoted using an ordinal number system (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), as numbers are a universal concept that are understandable at an elementary level education and transverse language barriers much easier.

Typically, many companies use a positional referencing system based on the user centered within the fort positioned looking at Gate 2, and call it the "front middle" gate. This is advised against for multiple reasons.

* Surprisingly, the most prevalent issue with positional referencing is that users mix up left and right.
* Not only do users now have to denote left, middle, or right, but also front or back.
* Not all users understand what front or back means without explanation.
* When front or back isn't explicitly stated, users assume front.

When any of the above issues are present within a group of 50 people this can lead to *catastrophic* failures of execution. Especially within the last 10 minutes of an Invasion where Gates being demolished are punished heavily.

**Proper numeric ordinal references should be adopted widely within the community to eliminate referential errors.**
