# Roles
Typically, your Invasion leader will denote specific roles to each group within the Army. This is the simplest for most users to understand and allows clear and direct placement within the New World User Interface.

## Gate Groups
Gate groups are groups that do what you think they would do, stand by and protect a Gate. Typically, each Gate Group will consist of four damage dealers and one healer.

It is recommended to have at least one Spear user in each group that can apply three stacks of ![Rend Icon](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/status/se_rendt1.png) [Rend](https://nwdb.info/db/status-effect/spear_perforate_rend_upgrade) with ![Perforate Icon](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/icons/abilities/spear_perforate.png) [Perforate](https://nwdb.info/db/ability/ability_spear_perforate) and ![Rupturing Strikes Icon](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/icons/abilities/spear_perforate_bonusrend.png) [Rupturing Strikes](https://nwdb.info/db/ability/ability_spear_perforate_bonusrend), which significantly decreases the resistances of bosses at that gate.

For Gates in the back of the fort, it can be very helpful to have Greataxe users with ![Gravity Well Icon](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/icons/abilities/greataxe_ability6_gravitywell.png) [Gravity Well](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/icons/abilities/spear_perforate_bonusrend.png) to stop larger groups of Bombers from reaching the gates during times when Fortification groups are overwhelmed or reloading.

For the remainder of damage dealers, ranged damage is preferential due to the lethality of bosses like Commanders and Spriggans.
