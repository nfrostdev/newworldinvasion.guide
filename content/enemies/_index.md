# Enemies
Enemies are listed in order of priority for elimination.

## ![Brute Icon](/img/icons/brute.svg) Bombers
**Bombers are the biggest threat to the success of your defense at all stages.**

Having low health and dealing high area and siege damage, after death, Bombers are critical to eliminate in all circumstances.

Spawning in small groups on either side of the corruption zones, area-of-effect damage is highly effective against them.

Two Bombers exploding in a group of players is enough to completely wipe that defense force. Users with less Constitution will die to the explosion of a single Bomber.

## ![Brute Icon](/img/icons/brute.svg) Spriggans
**Having wide, heavy hitting swings, Spriggans pose a serious threat to your structures and Melee Damage Dealers.**

Spriggans can and should be taunted and pulled away from structures if Tanks are present in groups near them.

Damage Dealers that are present on the ground and deal high amounts of damage that pull aggro should do the same as if they were a Tank, move the Spriggan away from structures.

Spriggans are stopped entirely by ![Gravity Well Icon](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/icons/abilities/greataxe_ability6_gravitywell.png) [Gravity Well](https://cdn.nwdb.info/db/images/live/v2/icons/abilities/spear_perforate_bonusrend.png) for the duration of the ability; and if multiple Great Axe users are present, chaining the ability can prevent the Spriggan from reaching any structure in totality. Utilizing this ability in a coordinated manner can vastly increase the chance of success for your Army, saving valuable repair parts and movement time.
